I'm a postdoctoral researcher of [Computer Software Group](https://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html.en),
Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University.
I got Doctor of Science at Tokyo Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Hidehiko Masuhara](http://prg.is.titech.ac.jp/people/masuhara/).
I am also a member of [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/).

### Research Interest
<!-- My research interest is <b>programming languages</b> and <b>type systems</b>.
I'm currently working on the following research projects.
- Developing a new language mechanism for compatibility & dependency analysis at an expression-level.
- Gradual type systems that are introduced polymorphism in a space-efficient manner.

<u>Keyword:</u> effect/coeffect systems, metaprogramming, gradual type systems -->

My research interests are in <b>programming language design</b> and <b>programming language theory</b>.
Currently, I am working on the following research projects:
1. <i>Programming Language with Versions</i>: Research on a new language mechanism that incorporates versions into language semantics, which enables compatibility analysis and update support at the expression level, and on ensuring its safety.
2. <i>Space-efficient polymorphic gradual typing</i>: Research on introducing polymorphism in a gradual type system in a space-efficient manner.
3. <i>Safe Language Interoperability</i>: Research on a new verification method for programs developed in multiple languages.
