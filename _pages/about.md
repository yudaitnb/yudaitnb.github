I am an Assistant Professor of [Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/), [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english).
I received my B.S., M.S., and D.S. degrees from [Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/), [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) in 2018, 2020, and 2023 respectively. Formerly, I was a JSPS Research Fellow at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) (2022-2023), and a program-specific researcher (postdoc) of [Computer Software Group](https://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html.en), Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University (2023-2024).
I am also a member of [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/).

### Research Interest
<!-- My research interest is <b>programming languages</b> and <b>type systems</b>.
I'm currently working on the following research projects.
- Developing a new language mechanism for compatibility & dependency analysis at an expression-level.
- Gradual type systems that are introduced polymorphism in a space-efficient manner.

<u>Keyword:</u> effect/coeffect systems, metaprogramming, gradual type systems -->

My research interests are in <b>programming language design</b> and <b>programming language theory</b>.
Currently, I am working on the following research projects:
1. <i>Programming Language with Versions</i>: Research on a new language mechanism that incorporates versions into language semantics, which enables compatibility analysis and update support at the expression level, and on ensuring its safety.
2. <i>Space-efficient Polymorphic Gradual Typing</i>: Research on introducing polymorphism in a gradual type system in a space-efficient manner.
3. <i>Safe Language Interoperability</i>: Research on a new verification method for programs developed in multiple languages.
