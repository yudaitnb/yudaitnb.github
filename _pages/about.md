I am an Assistant Professor in [Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/), [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english), where I co-lead the [PRG-group](http://prg.is.titech.ac.jp/) alongside [Hidehiko Masuhara](https://prg.is.titech.ac.jp/people/masuhara/) and [Youyou Cong](https://sites.google.com/site/youyoucong212/).

I received my B.S., M.S., and D.S. degrees from [Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/), [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) in 2018, 2020, and 2023 respectively.

Formerly, I was a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellow at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) (2022-2023), and a program-specific researcher (postdocoral position) in [Computer Software Group](https://www.fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html.en), Department of Communications and Computer Engineering, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University (2023-2024).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
