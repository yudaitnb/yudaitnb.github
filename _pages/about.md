I am an Assistant Professor in [Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/), [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english).

I received B.S. degree from Department of Information Science, School of Science, [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) in 2018, and M.S. and D.S. degrees from [Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/), [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) 2020 and 2023 respectively.

Formerly, I was a JSPS Research Fellow at Tokyo Institute of Technology (2022-2023), and a program-specific researcher (postdoctoral position) at Kyoto University (2023-2024).

I am also a member of [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/).
